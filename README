To use this library, you need ry's http-parser, get it here:
    git clone git://github.com/ry/http-parser.git

To build this library, you need luarocks, get it here:
    http://www.luarocks.org/en/Download

    Then build it like this:

    luarocks make CFLAGS=-g

Loading the library:

    If you built the library as a loadable package
        [local] lhp = require 'http.parser'

    If you compiled the package statically into your application, call
    the function "luaopen_http_parser(L)". It will create a table with the
    http parser functions and leave it on the top of the stack.

To test the library run:

    ./test.lua

    ...assuming that the `lua` on your PATH properly uses the luarocks
    installed module.

API:

    parser = lhp.request {
        on_url          = function(url)  ... end
        on_path         = function(path) ... end
        on_query_string = function(qstr) ... end
        on_fragment     = function(frag) ... end
        on_header_field = function(hkey) ... end
        on_header_value = function(hval) ... end
        on_body         = function(body) ... end

        on_message_begin    = function() ... end
        on_message_complete = function() ... end
        on_headers_complete = function() ... end
    }
    parser = lhp.response { ... }

        Create a new HTTP parser to handle either an HTTP request or
        HTTP response respectively.  Pass in a table of callbacks that
        are ran when the parser encounters the various fields.  By
        default all callbacks will be ran with the full value for the
        respective field [but please see BUGS below].  At some point
        in the future, the on_body handler should *not* be buffered by
        default (but at the moment, the entire body has to be read
        before the on_body handler can execute).

    bytes_read = parser:execute(input_bytes)

        Feed the parser some partial input.  Returns how many bytes
        where read.  A short read may happen if a request is being
        "upgraded" or was an invalid format.  See parser:is_upgrade()
        below to differentiate between these two events (if you want
        to support an upgraded protocol).

    parser:should_keep_alive()

        Returns true if this TCP connection should be "kept alive"
        so that it can be re-used for a future request/response.
        If this returns false and you are the server, then respond
        with the "Connection: close" header.  If you are the client,
        then simply close the connection.

    parser:is_upgrade()

        Returns true if the input request wants to "upgrade" to a
        different protocol.

    parser:method()

        Returns the name of the request method.  This is only valid
        on HTTP requests.

    parser:status_code()

        Returns the HTTP status code of a response.  This is only valid
        on HTTP responses.

== BUGS ==

 * If you register an on_url _and_ an (on_path, on_query_string or
   on_fragment) handler, then the events will not be properly
   buffered into a single event.

 * The on_body callback should not be buffered by default.

 * There is no way to disable buffering of events.
